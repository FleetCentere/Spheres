### Coding notes ###
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install: flask, flask-sqlalchemy python-dotenv flask_login



### BestPractices ###
1: Flask Blueprint to modularize the code
#example structure:
/activity-tracker
├── app.py
├── /auth
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── routes.py
├── /tasks
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── routes.py
├── /templates
├── /stati

2: Adopt MVC pattern
3: Use comments and docstrings
4: User a linter and formatter like Flask8 or Black
5: use environment vars to store sensitive data like keys or database creds (create a .env and install python-dotenv to load)
6: enable HTTPS from the start, and use flask-talisman for security headers
7: sanitize user inputs
8: hash passwords using bcrypt
9: use feature branches in version control to isolate work on new features
10: write clear commit messages that explain each commit
11: user Github Issuer or Kanban board to track tasks and bugs
12: Use databsse indexes for frequently queried fields
13: Minimize number of SQL queries per request by using relaionships
14: Use pagination to handle large data sets
15: Implement caching with Redis or Flask-Caching for frequently accessed data
16: optimize static files by compressing images and minifying CSS/JS
17: write unit tests for key components using pytest
18: set up CI piplines with Github Actions to run tests automatically
19: Use Flask-RESTful or Flask-API to design clean APIs
20: Document API using Swagger or Postman
21: Use Flask-Logginr or Sentry to track errors
22: Gracefully handle errors and show user-friendly error messages
23: Add monitoring tools like Prometheus for performance tracking

    Category	Best Practices
    Code Organization	Use Blueprints, follow MVC, add docstrings, use linters.
    Security	Use environment variables, HTTPS, sanitize inputs, hash passwords.
    Performance	Use indexes, pagination, caching, and static file optimization.
    Collaboration	Use Git branches, clear commits, GitHub Issues/Kanban.
    Testing & CI	Write unit tests, automate tests with GitHub Actions.
    API Design	Use Flask-RESTful, document with Swagger/Postman.
    Monitoring	Set up logging, use Sentry for error tracking.
